Showtime-Csharp
===============

C# implementation of Showtime library.

*Requirements:*
- [NetMq for .net 3.5](https://github.com/Mystfit/netmq/tree/Net35Compat-BindRandom). The odd version requirement is because this branch was built to function with Unity.

Compile using Visual Studio 2013 or include the ZstShowtime project in your own solution.
